# Gambit

Gambit is a really simple flashcards viewer for Android.

## Features

* Simple UI — no pasarán things that you’ll never use.
* Shuffle your cards if you want to give yourself an extra
training. Do you want it? Just shake your phone and it’ll be done.
* There are thousands of cards and you’d forgot where did you stop?
No problema — Gambit remembers your current position in deck.
